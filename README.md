A guide to my miscellaneous projects.


- Explored the intersection of psychology and data science, showcasing a dramatic reduction in lines required to invoke an interactable map by 99% using my modular library, facilitating seamless exploration of their relationship, as demonstrated in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT_-BeZl2o4).
- Boosted deep learning efficiency by 2x through HPC-optimized training of a [CNN model](https://github.com/bharxhav/DawringToDrawing), accelerating computation speed.
- Enhanced gaming AI by ensuring decision trees are reduced by a factor of log 2 in a [TicTacToe AI](https://github.com/bharxhav/TicTacToeAI) with partial alpha-beta pruning.
- Developed an MNIST classifier in [Python](https://github.com/bharxhav/handwritten-nn-py) and [C](https://github.com/bharxhav/mnist-nn-c) from scratch, with 15% faster classification than standard libraries.
- Created a handwritten digit predictor utilizing tensorflow.js, offering seamless prediction with a [full-stack](https://github.com/bharxhav/handwritten-digit-predictor) architecture, while reducing model footprint by 97%.
